Description
===========

PingInfoView is a small utility that allows you to easily ping multiple
host names and IP addresses, and watch the result in one table. It
automatically ping to all hosts every number of seconds that you specify,
and displays the number of succeed and failed pings, as well as the
average ping time. You can also save the ping result into text/html/xml
file, or copy it to the clipboard.



System Requirements
===================

This utility works under Windows 2000, Windows XP, Windows Server 2003,
Windows Server 2008, Windows Server 2012, Windows Server 2016, Windows
Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8, and Windows 10. Older versions of Windows
are not supported.



Versions History
================


* Version 2.05
  o Added 'Display Mode' option (Under the Options menu), which
    allows you to view only the hosts with succeeded pings or to view
    only the hosts with failed pings.
  o Added 'Add Header Line To CSV/Tab-Delimited File' option (Turned
    on by default).

* Version 2.02
  o Added new column: 'Total Sent Pings'.

* Version 2.01
  o Added 'Start As Hidden' option (Enabled only when 'Put Icon On
    Tray' option is on).
  o When both 'Start As Hidden' and 'Put Icon On Tray' options are
    turned on - PingInfoView starts to ping instantly when you run it
    without displaying the main window.

* Version 2.00
  o Added support for TCP pings. You can now specify the host name or
    IP address with a port number (e.g: 192.168.0.100:80 192.168.1.10:443
    www.nirsoft.net:443 ) and PingInfoView will check the TCP conection
    in the specified port number instead of using ICMP pings.

* Version 1.86
  o Added option to specify IP addresses range in CIDR format (e.g:
    192.168.0.0/24)
  o Added option to choose another font (name and size) to display in
    the main window.

* Version 1.85
  o Added IP options: Time To Live and Don't Fragment.

* Version 1.82
  o Fixed to sort properly the 'Last Succeed On' and 'Last Failed On'
    columns.

* Version 1.81
  o Fixed bug with resizing the 'Ping Options' window.

* Version 1.80
  o Added new option: Beep On Succeeded Pings (After Failure).
  o Fixed bug: When the lower pane option was turned off,
    PingInfoView didn't add the pings to the log file.

* Version 1.75
  o Added 'Resolve host name to IP address on every ping' option. If
    the IP address of the host you ping may change, you should turn on
    this option , so when the IP address is changed, PingInfoView will
    ping the new IP address.
  o Added new option in 'Advanced Options' window: 'Limit the total
    number of accumulated pings' (Default is 50000). If you run
    PingInfoView for long period of time, you should use this option.
    Otherwise, the accumuated ping result will consume a lot of memory,
    and eventually PingInfoView will respond very slowly or crash.
  o Added 'Window Title' field. The text you type here will appear in
    the title of the main window.

* Version 1.70
  o Automatic export feature: You can now choose to generate a new
    filename on every session (When you close the program and then run it
    again) or on every save. You can also generate a filename with
    date/time (e.g: ping20170925112130.csv) instead of numeric counter.

* Version 1.65
  o The 'Consecutive Failed Count' column now keeps the last value
    when pings are ok again.
  o Added 'Max Consecutive Failed Count' column which displays the
    maximum number of consecutive failed pings and 'Max Consecutive
    Failed Time' which displays the date/time that the maximum number of
    consecutive failed pings was detected.
  o Added 'Add only failed pings' option to the 'Lower Pane Mode' in
    'Advanced Options' window.

* Version 1.60
  o Added option to automatically export the current pings status to
    a file (csv/tab-delimited/html/xml) every xx seconds (In 'Advanced
    Options' window).
  o Added option to execute a command on ping failure.
  o Added option to specify the number of consecutive failed pings to
    trigger the sound/beep alert and the failed command executaion.
  o Added 'Consecutive Failed Count' column.

* Version 1.55
  o Added option to choose the type of beep/sound to use when a ping
    fails (In 'Advanced Options' window).
  o Added option to add all ping results or only the failed pings
    into a comma-delimited or tab-delimited log file (In 'Advanced
    Options' window).
  o Added option to stop adding the ping results into the lower pane
    (In 'Advanced Options' window). It's recommended to use this option
    if you have large amount of pings, because the accumulation of ping
    results consumes a lot of memory and eventually causes PingInfoView
    to crash.
  o When 'Use IP-Host Description format' option is turned on,
    PingInfoView now adds the IP address even if it doesn't have a
    description.

* Version 1.51
  o On IP-Host format, if you put '#' in the beginning of the line,
    PingInfoView will consider it as a remark line and ignore it.

* Version 1.50
  o Added option to specify the ping size (The default is 32 bytes).
  o Added 'Order' column, which specifies the original order of
    hosts, as you typed in the 'Ping Options' window.

* Version 1.45
  o Added option to control the maximum number of concurrent pings
    (In 'Advanced Options' window - F9). The default value is 500.
  o Fixed bug: PingInfoView failed to remember the last size/position
    of the main window if it was not located in the primary monitor.

* Version 1.43
  o Fixed bug: When using PingInfoView from command-line,
    /IPHostDescFormat and some other command-line options failed to work
    properly.

* Version 1.42
  o Fixed issue: When editing PingInfoView_hosts.txt with external
    editor that adds Byte order mark to the file, PingInfoView failed to
    handle the first host name.

* Version 1.41
  o Added 'Sort On Every Update' option.

* Version 1.40
  o Added 'Auto Scroll Lower Pane' option.
  o Fixed bug: In some circumstances, when using 'Copy Selected
    Items' on the lower pane, PingInfoView copied the wrong items or
    crashed.
  o Improved the ability of PingInfoView to handle hundreds or
    thousants of IP addresses in the same time.

* Version 1.36
  o Added 'Auto Size Columns+Headers' option, which allows you to
    automatically resize the columns according to the row values and
    column headers.
  o Fixed issue: The properties and the options windows opened in the
    wrong monitor, on multi-monitors system.

* Version 1.35
  o Added a lower pane that lists the result of all pings for the
    selected IP address in the upper pane. (You can disable this feature
    by unchecking the 'Show Lower Pane' option under the Options menu)

* Version 1.30
  o PingInfoView now resolves the IP addresses and displays the
    result under the 'Host Name' column.
  o Added 'Minimum Ping Time' and 'Maximum Ping Time' columns.

* Version 1.28
  o Fixed the sorting problem of 'IP Address' and 'Reply IP Address'
    column.

* Version 1.27
  o Made another workaround that hopefully will solve the mysterious
    problem that people report where PingInfoView stop pinging after
    hours of continuous work. PingInfoView now check the pinging status,
    and if the pings stoped from some reason, PingInfoView should start
    them again.

* Version 1.26
  o Added command-line options to make a single ping test and save it
    to html/text/xml/csv file.
  o Fixed some problems with the xml file.

Using PingInfoView
==================

PingInfoView doesn't require any installation process or additional dll
files. In order to start using it, simply run the executable file
(PingInfoView.exe), type the host names and IP addresses that you want to
ping, and click the 'Ok' button to start pinging.
Starting from version 2.00, you can also specify a TCP port number (e.g:
192.168.0.100:80 192.168.1.10:443 ) in order to test a TCP connection
(TCP Ping) instead of using ICMP pings. Be aware that PingInfoView only
tests the TCP connection itself, it doesn't try to send or receive data
from the server.



Known Issues
============


* If you ping to a lot of hosts concurrently, PingInfoView may return a
  failed result to some of the hosts, even if the hosts are ok. In order
  to solve this issue, go to the 'Advanced Options' and decrease the
  maximum number of concurrent pings.



Use IP-Host Description format
==============================

When this option is selected, you should specify the IP addresses list in
the following format:

192.168.1.10 Main Server
192.168.1.11 Host 01
192.168.1.12 Host 02
192.168.1.30:443 HTTPS Web Site
192.168.1.31:25 SMTP Server
#192.168.1.14 Host 03

The description of each IP address is automatically added to the
description column. When port number is specified, TCP ping is used
instead of ICMP ping. If you add '#' character in the beginning of the
line, PingInfoView will ignore it.



Command-Line Options

Translating PingInfoView to other languages
===========================================

In order to translate PingInfoView to other language, follow the
instructions below:
1. Run PingInfoView with /savelangfile parameter:
   PingInfoView.exe /savelangfile
   A file named PingInfoView_lng.ini will be created in the folder of
   PingInfoView utility.
2. Open the created language file in Notepad or in any other text
   editor.
3. Translate all string entries to the desired language. Optionally,
   you can also add your name and/or a link to your Web site.
   (TranslatorName and TranslatorURL values) If you add this information,
   it'll be used in the 'About' window.
4. After you finish the translation, Run PingInfoView, and all
   translated strings will be loaded from the language file.
   If you want to run PingInfoView without the translation, simply rename
   the language file, or move it to another folder.
